# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Implementation of dynamic arrays.
2. **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Implementation of stack data structure.
4. **Queues**: Implementation of queue data structure.
5. **Trees**: Implementation of binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees.
6. **Graphs**: Implementation of graph data structure using adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
7. **Hash Tables**: Implementation of hash table data structure.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of popular sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, etc.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Implementation of searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, etc.
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Implementation of breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, etc.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Implementation of dynamic programming algorithms for problems like the 0/1 knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.
5. **Greedy Algorithms**: Implementation of greedy algorithms like the coin change problem, activity selection problem, etc.

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in separate C++ files. You can simply compile and run the desired files to see the implementations in action. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
